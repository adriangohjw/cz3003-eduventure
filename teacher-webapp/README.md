## Quick Start

#### 1. Clone this repo and start up the database as per the instructions on the main README
use ```python run_test.py``` to load up the sample database with pre-populated data.  
use ```python run.py``` to run a blank database.

#### 2. CD into the teacher-webapp folder and run `yarn install` from command prompt
You only have to run this step the first time this repo is cloned or if any requirements have changed.  
This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

#### 4. Run `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
