## Setting up local environment (Windows)

This is a very simplified guide on setting up local environment for Windows

Pre-requisite:

1. Installed `python3`
2. Installed `pip`

### Setting up repository

1. Go to a folder where you want the repository to be in
2. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/adriangohjw/cz3003-eduventure.git`

### Setting up PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the relational DBMS of choice in this project
 
1. Download and install PostgreSQL from [Windows installers](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
 2. Use the following credentials during the installation (otherwise you can update the Config file):
	 1. Username = `postgres` and password = `localhostdbpassword`
 3. Open the psql command-line tool by 
	 1. In the Windows CMD, run the command: `psql -U postgres`  
	 2. Enter password when prompted
	 3. Run the command: `create database "cz3003"`

### Setup virtual environment in project

In Windows CMD, ensure you are in the folder of your repository

1. Run `python â€“m venv venv`
2. Run `venv\Scripts\activate` 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

All required packages should have been installed!

`venv\Scripts\activate` is also the <b>command to enter your virtual environment</b> whenever you want to run the application on CMD

### Setup local database
In Windows CMD, ensure you are in the folder of your repository

1. Run `python manage.py db init` 
2. Run `python manage.py db migrate`
3. Run `python manage.py db upgrade`

## To run the application
`python run.py`

## To populate the database with mock data
`python db_populate\db_populate.py`

- WARNING: It will wipe the entire local test DB clean, before populating it with mock data
- To populate in local actual DB, replace `from run_test import create_app` with `from run import create_app`, save the file and execute the same command

## Testing the API endpoints

1. Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Import the collection (cz3003-eduventure.postman_collection.json). Alternatively, import the collection from this [link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/7df24ad60406f871aa36) for the most updated version

## Running test scripts

`python tests.py`
